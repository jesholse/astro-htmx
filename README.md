## ðŸ‘€ What is this?

This site uses Astro's view transition between pages and HTMx for comments together with Tailwind for design and layout. The site is not connected to a real API.
The API is located in the /pages/api/ folder.

It has no reponsive design.

HTMx only works after page change if htmx.process(document.body) is executed. If not, HTMx will not regonize DOM changes and will stop working. HTMx.process is executed as a script in the head.

Firefox isn't currently supporting the view transition API and therefore this site should run in Google Chrome.
